# catbot-api

Porting cat bot's non discord functions to an api. Mainly for practice, but also to restructure the bot a bit. Might package it into a python lib at some point


Day 1: I'm pretty much done porting the non discord functions. Will probably start to branch out to new ones from here. Mental health: still sane
